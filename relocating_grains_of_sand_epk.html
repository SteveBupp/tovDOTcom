        <h1 class="title">Relocating Grains of Sand</h1>

        <p>On his latest project, 'Relocating Grains of Sand', Vomit finds himself teaming up with Bronx by way
            of Baltimore beat maker and artist, Height Keech. The album is a concept piece about time passing,
            growth, and change. Emcee, The Taste of Vomit, uses his signature vulnerability, complex rhyme
            schemes, and wit, to muse on topics like mortality, getting older, chasing your dreams,
            gentrification, therapy, relationships, and healing; while producer, Height Keech (Wave Generators,
            Cold Rhymes Records), lays a foundation of unique beats that blend a mix of psychedelic rock, soul,
            and 60s/70s pop samples, with often hard hitting early Def Jam reminiscent drums (and the occasional
            spacey synth). TOV and Height find themselves joined by a crew of underground legends including,
            vocal guest appearances by Curly Castro (ShrapKnel, Wrecking Crew, Backwoodz), Blueprint (Soul
            Position, Rhymesayers, Def Jux, Weightless), Andrew (Sleeping Dogs, Three Dollar Pistol, Swimming
            Costume), Emyne The Superstar, Wade Wilson (Dreadpool Parker, Cold Rhymes Records), Miggs Sonny
            (Four Elements and Beyond), and of course, Height Keech, himself; with DJ cuts by Orlando's own,
            SoundTec. 'Relocating Grains of Sand' tells the story of that in-between space of youthful curiosity
            and the wisdom of old age; where everything starts to change and one begins to truly become a part
            of their own destiny and understanding. Its an optimistic and hopeful take on the process of
            becoming comfortable in your own skin, and truly discovering who you are. All the while never losing
            sight of the foundation of dope rhymes and stink face inducing beats.</p>
